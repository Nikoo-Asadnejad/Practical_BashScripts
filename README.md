## Ensure executables:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

## Run:
```bash
./script_name.sh
```

## 1. Backup Script (`backup.sh`)

This script creates a backup of a specified directory and stores it in a backup directory with the current date.

- **Usage**: Update the `SOURCE_DIR` and `BACKUP_DIR` variables with the paths you want to back up and where you want to store the backup.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ./backup.sh

## 2. Disk Usage Alert (disk_usage_alert.sh)

This script checks the disk usage of the root partition and sends an alert email if it exceeds a specified threshold.
- **Usage**: Set the THRESHOLD variable to the desired disk usage limit (in percentage) and update the EMAIL variable with the recipientâ€™s email address.
- **Command**:
    ```bash
   ./disk_usage_alert.sh

## 3. System Update and Cleanup (system_update_cleanup.sh)
This script updates the system, cleans up unnecessary files, and removes unused packages to free up space.

- **Usage**: Run the script with root privileges to update and clean the system.
- **Command**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./system_update_cleanup.sh

## 4. Monitor Server Uptime (monitor_uptime.sh)
This script logs the server uptime to a file. It can be set to run at regular intervals using a cron job.
- **Usage**: Run the script to log the uptime periodically.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ./monitor_uptime.sh

## 6. Service Status Check (service_status_check.sh)
This script checks the status of a specified service and restarts it if it is not running.
- **Usage**: Set the SERVICE variable to the service you want to monitor (e.g., nginx) and update the EMAIL variable with the recipientâ€™s email address.
- **Command**:
   ```bash
   .sudo ./service_status_check.sh

-	Ensure you have the required permissions to run the scripts (use chmod +x script_name.sh to make them executable).
- Some scripts may require root privileges; use sudo where applicable.

# Setting Up Bash Scripts as Cron Jobs :

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to add various Bash scripts as cron jobs on Linux systems.
Cron jobs allow you to schedule scripts to run automatically at specified intervals, making it easier to manage system maintenance, monitoring, and automation tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure the scripts are executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /path/to/your_script.sh

- Some scripts may require root privileges. Use sudo where applicable.

- Add Scripts as Cron Jobs:

  ```bash
  crontab -e
 
 - Add entries to the crontab file in the following format:
     <p> * * * * * /path/to/your_script.sh </p>

Cron Scheduling Patterns: 
- <p>* * * * *: Runs every minute.</p>
-	<p>0 * * * *: Runs at the start of every hour.</p>
-  <p>0 0 * * *: Runs daily at midnight.</p>
-	<p>0 2 * * 0: Runs every Sunday at 2:00 AM.</p>
- <p>*/5 * * * *: Runs every 5 minutes.</p>
